# micropython-smbus
A wrapper to provide methods of the CPython 'smbus' module on micropython

## Work In Progress
This module came from a desire to use https://github.com/pimoroni/bme680 on a LoPy, so currently implements only the methods necessary to do that. 

I'll be adding more as time goes on: issues/pull requests are very welcome.
